In '87, Huey released Fore!, their most accomplished album. <br/> <br/>
I think their undisputed masterpiece is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB5YkmjalDg">Hip To Be Square</a>. <br/> <br/>
A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. <br/> <br/>
But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. <br/> <br/>
It's also a personal statement about the band itself.
