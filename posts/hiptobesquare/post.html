In '87, Huey released <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5L0vaNLbzgP8RIJqs1zamE?si=1HrS27eqSRaFBX8bCX1V4g">Fore!</a>, their most accomplished album. <br/> <br/>
I think their undisputed masterpiece is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/648BMGrt98kUbLo24A4vgj?si=_xFKnZjgT3Gb8nCtDyX_UA">Hip To Be Square</a>. <br/> <br/>
A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. <br/> <br/>
But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. <br/> <br/>
It's also a personal statement about the band itself.
