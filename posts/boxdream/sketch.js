	//notice the loop doesn't start at 0 -
	//this means the center is at x = 0, y = 0
	//which is useful for finding your distance from it as well as drawing it in 3D

			//so now that we know everything about this box we're about to draw, let's draw it
			push(); //push a new matrix on the matrix stack because I want to be able to go back where I came from really easily
	    translate(x,y); //move the matrix to my box position
	    noStroke(); //outlines slow this down a lot, we don't need them anyhow
	    fill(h, 180, 255); //fill the boxes with a color of the hue, desaturate it a tiny bit (150) and give it full brightness (255)
	    box(scl, scl, zscl); //draw the box, two of its sides will always be the same, only the height changes
			pop(); //return to the original matrix. this would also work without push and pop by calling translate(-x,-y) here but whatevs, push and pop are really comfy to use
